1. download node first, will come with an package manager called npm, (preferably the LTS version)
2. clone this repository and go into the directory with your terminal
3. use `npm i` to install the dependencies
4. and finally do `node .` to run the web server, now you can connect to it with the plugin

by the way if you want to disable the chrome popup you can change
```js
{ headless: false }
```
to
```js
{ headless: true }
```
